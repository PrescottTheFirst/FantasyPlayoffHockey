<p>For each correct pick you get 4 points, with a bonus for picking an upset.  The bonus is the difference in the seeds, divided by 2, rounded up.  So if 8th place beats 1st place, thats 7/2 which rounds up to a bonus of 4.  Two more points are awarded for correctly guessing the winner AND the number of games, with a bonus of 2 more if you correctly guess a sweep.  The goal differential entry is across the entire series, relative to the team you choose to win.  For example if I say that LA will beat Vancouver but Vancouver will score 2 more goals, my pick will be -2.  This will be used as a tiebreaker at the end.
